: {Solver [http://kalyaninagaraj.github.io/code/cgRSPLINE_v2.zip cgR-SPLINE]} Solves stochastically constrained simulation optimization problems on integer spaces (Last updated: February 2017)

: {Co-developer and contibutor of the open-source Sim-Opt Library} of solvers and problems in simulation optimization. The library is now hosted [https://github.com/simopt-admin/simopt/wiki here] on GitHub. The old website is maintained [http://simopt.org/oldindex.php here].

: {R-SPLINE}
Wrote a C implementation of the R-SPLINE simulation optimization algorithm, later incorporated by SAS Inc. in their SAS-OR tool.
